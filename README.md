# Members Only (authentication project)

## About

The goal of this project was to understand the foundations of authentication in Ruby on Rails by creating different form layouts that ask the user for different data, so they can have their own account. We set up the user controllers, models and views with the help of the devise gem and render each using bootstrap.
